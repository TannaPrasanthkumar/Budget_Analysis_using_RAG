      "\n",
      "Enhanced Limit of Standard Deduction and Family Pension Deduction Under New Regime\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the new regime, the standard deduction for salaried individuals has been increased to Rs. 75,000 from Rs. 50,000. Similarly, a deduction on family pension for persons having pension income has been increased to Rs. 25,000 from Rs. 15,000 if they file taxes under the new regime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Changes in Tax Structure Under the New Regime\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the New tax regime, the tax structure is revised as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: As a result of the above changes, a salaried employee in the new tax regime can save up to Rs. 17,500 in taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simplification of Taxation of Capital Gains\n",
      "\n",
      "For classifying assets into long-term and short-term, there will only be two holding periods: 12 months and 24 months. The 36-month holding period has been removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The holding period for all listed securities is 12 months. All listed securities with a holding period exceeding 12 months are considered Long-Term. The holding period for all other assets is 24 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlisted bonds and debentures are brought in line with the taxation on debt mutual funds and market-linked debentures. They will attract tax on capital gains at applicable slab rates. (i.e., they will be treated as short-term irrespective of the period of holding.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The taxation of Short-Term Capital Gain for listed equity shares, a unit of an equity-oriented fund, and a unit of a business trust has been increased to 20% from 15%. Other financial and non-financial assets which are held for short term shall continue to attract the tax at slab rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the benefit of the lower and middle-income classes, the limit on the exemption of Long-Term Capital Gains on the transfer of equity shares or equity-oriented units or units of Business Trust has increased from Rs.1 Lakh to Rs.1.25 lakh per year. However, the rate at which it is taxed has increased from 10% to 12.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exemption limit to Rs. 1.25 lakhs has been increased for the whole of the year, whereas the tax rate changed on 23rd July 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tax on long-term capital gains on other financial and non-financial assets is reduced from 20% to 12.5%. While on the other hand, the indexation benefit that previously was available on sale of long-term assets, has now been done away with. So, any sale of long term asset made from 23rd July, 2024, will attract tax rate of 12.5% only without indexation benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is to be noted that the provision regarding availing the benefit of FMV of asset as on 01.04.2001 as cost while selling the asset, is still available even after the recent changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Changes in TDS Rates\n",
      "\n",
      "Budget 2024 reduced the TDS rates on specified payments to facilitate business and improve taxpayer compliance. However, TDS rates are effective only either after 1st Oct 2024 or 1st April 2025. The table below shows the specified payments.\n",

      "\n",

      "Abolishment of Angel Tax\n",
      "\n",
      "The Angel tax provisions of Section 56(2)(viib) has been proposed to be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Angel Tax is a tax levied on companies that issue fresh shares to investors at a price above the company's Fair Market Value. The excess of the Issue Price over and above the FMV was made taxable u/s 56(2)(viii) as an angel tax in the hands of the Company. This provision is proposed to be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The startup ecosystem will benefit considering the frequent fund raise that can happen in startups and the compliance cost and the time that is consumed by the said provision while conducting a fund raise in start up.\n",
